<p>Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get do something. Meanwhile, we find time to talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call "Beer and Tell".</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/Beer_And_Tell/February2015">wiki page available</a> with a list of the presenters, as well as links to their presentation materials. There's also a <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/webdev-beer-and-tell-february-2015/">recording available</a> courtesy of Air Mozilla.</p>

<h2>Name: Project</h2>
<p>Details</p>

<p>We did things!</p>

<p>If you're interested in attending the next Beer and Tell, sign up for the <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-webdev">dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list</a>. An email is sent out a week beforehand with connection details. You could even add yourself to the wiki and show off your side-project!</p>

<p>See you next month!</p>
