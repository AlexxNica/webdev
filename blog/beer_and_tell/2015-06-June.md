Once a month, web developers from across the Mozilla Project get together to try
and transmute a fresh Stanford graduate into a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, we find
time to talk about our side projects and drink, an occurrence we like to call
"Beer and Tell".

There's a [wiki page available][wiki] with a list of the presenters, as well as
links to their presentation materials. There's also a
[recording available][recording] courtesy of Air Mozilla.

## Osmose: SpeedKills and Advanced Open File
First up was [Osmose][] (that's me!) presenting two packages for [Atom][], a
text editor. [SpeedKills][] is a playful package that plays a guitar solo and
sets text on fire when the user types fast enough. [Advanced Open File][] is a
more useful package that adds a convenient dialog for browsing the file system
and opening files by path rather than using the fuzzy finder. Both are available
for install through the Atom package repository.

## new_one: Tab Origin
Next was new_one, who shared [Tab Origin][], a Firefox add-on that lets you
return to the webpage that launched the current tab, even if the parent tab has
since been closed. It's activated via a keyboard shortcut that can be
customized.

## Potch: WONTFIX and Presentation Mode
Continuing a fine tradition of batching projects, [Potch][] stopped by to show
off two Firefox add-ons. The first was [WONTFIX][], which adds a large red
WONTFIX stamp to any [Bugzilla][] bug that has been marked as WONTFIX. The
second was [Presentation Mode][], which allows you to full-screen any content in
a web page while hiding the browser chrome. This is especially useful when
giving web-based presentations.

## Peterbe: premailer.io
[Peterbe][] shared [premailer.io][], which is a service wrapping [premailer][].
Premailer takes a block of HTML with a style tag and applies the styles within
as style attributes on each matching tag. This is mainly useful for HTML emails,
which generally don't support style tags that apply to the entire email.

We were only able to get a 3x engineer this month, but at least they were able
to get a decent job working on enterprise software.

If you're interested in attending the next Beer and Tell, sign up for the
[dev-webdev@lists.mozilla.org mailing list][mailing-list]. An email is sent out
a week beforehand with connection details. You could even add yourself to the
wiki and show off your side-project!

See you next month!
